## Airbnb Data Tool

### Overview:
This project will involve using **Inside Airbnb** data to help hosts optimise their listings. The main goal is to develop a tool that provides actionable insights for hosts, such as:

- **Pricing recommendations**: Suggest optimal prices based on market trends and property characteristics.
- **Peak booking times**: Forecast the busiest times for bookings and provide guidance on when hosts should adjust their prices.
- **Feature preferences**: Analyze which property features (e.g., amenities, location) are most valued by guests.
- **Property description optimization**: Use data to guide hosts on how best to write property descriptions that attract more guests.

### ML Potential:
This project offers a lot of room for applying machine learning techniques. Some key ML tasks could include:

- **Regression models**: To predict optimal pricing based on factors like location, property type, and current market conditions.
- **Time series forecasting**: To anticipate peak booking periods and help hosts adjust their prices at the right time.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analysing guest reviews to uncover insights about what features guests care about most.
- **Clustering or classification**: Segmenting the market based on property types or guest demographics to tailor recommendations.
- **Recommender systems**: Suggesting improvements for property descriptions or amenities based on past data.
