# Notes during Meeting 2
Airbnb tool to predict optimal pricing and feature importance
Apply this method and drill into residuals how a human estate agent or consultant will perform or give a better accuracy
Could follow estate agent approach and predict too
COmpetitors: airbnb algorithm and humans
COuld create website and gamify listings and get people to predict values and compare to my model.
Compare if humans are better than AI
- do website method since it's not been done

if we try and dont get them finished then its fine
Could get model to 

Literature review:
- real reason is to prepare for project. gather techniques, expected inputs outputs, data collection etc

Say yes that I will need human subjects.

have an iframe that loaded airbnb site and hid any information that i want hidden from user
have a box at the bottom that says what is your predicted price of this?
show 10 properties and they have to price 10.

Use listing price as final price to compare

active owners may price listing higher
real price is price in the middle of two extremes (desperate to stay vs desperate to leave)
time series forecasting to determine peak periods

phase 1:
what data i need to collect that will influence price
do they have enough info in them (depending on what time of year, this is what they can expect)
scrape data over period if not enough.

use papers i have and find the papers they reference
- find 10 to 20 papers
airbnb papers, estate agent pricing, hotel pricing, property evaluation

could use brighton, blackpool (seaside places)
capture seaside towns as an example.

could bring market segmentation in airbnb into lit review
- whos staying, whos letting.

Thinking about whos in the market, 
summer holidays - family friendly accom boosted
conference time - single room accom boosted

5 topics with 2/3 pages of discussion.

lit review:
- overview of airbnb, what advert looks like
- how people price their listings currently
- what datasets are available, how i would scrape data
- how people have approached price prediction in the past (look at papers)
- success they had and additional things i could bring (chatgpt to make judgment or convert image info into text that can be fed into models)
- section on how i would involve human participants
- how the tool im planning will be implemented front-end 
- could drop topics if i write more on certain topics

display advert hide images, display advert hide info and collect data on their estimates

google cloud credits.

random forests should run fine on normal machine


things i would do:
- fill out form and say i will be involving human subjects
- have a think about things i been discussing
- plan literature review and start research
- could start loading in data and maybe start coding
- - simple model predicting price on bedrooms as a beginner i guess
- - start basic and add things as time passes
- - try with inside airbnb dataset on seaside town.
