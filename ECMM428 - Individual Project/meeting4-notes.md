# Meeting 4 Notes

## Prior to Meeting
- Note about whether I should add info on linking clustering back to airbnb


## During Meeting
Write plan:
- Introduction - set out the aim (with motivation) for papers on why airbnb is good.
- Context - bit more focused on airbnb and pricing properties
- Who is booking these things and whats important to them (market segmentation) (domain knowledge)
- Talk about data available - cover data techniques and results
- Datasets and data availability (airbnb website vs premade like inside airbnb)
- - go into legal and ethical aspects
- write a paragraph (about a quarter to half a page) talking about info on properties, location etc

Read papers on similar to what I'm doing
note down techniques used
Highlight best techniques
Reference core pieces like books

quarter setting out context
half for the key literature review where I am comparing other papers

table summarising key info on papers

Around 8-10 good references on what I'm going to do and another 10 ish on general data, techniques etc
