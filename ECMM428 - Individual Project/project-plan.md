# Airbnb Data Tool: Project Roadmap

## 1. Define Project Scope
- **Key Deliverables**: Clearly define what the tool should achieve. Prioritise core functionalities such as pricing recommendations, peak booking forecasts, and property description optimisation. Establish the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to focus on essential features first and expand iteratively.
- **Target Users**: Decide whether the tool is aimed at beginner hosts or a broader audience. Understanding the users will shape the design of the user experience (UX) and the outputs of the tool.

## 2. Data Collection
- **Accessing Inside Airbnb Data**: 
  - Download datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for the relevant regions.
  - The datasets include information on listings (price, number of bedrooms, reviews, etc.), hosts, and booking patterns.
  - Start by working with data from a single city or region to limit the project’s scope initially, then expand as needed.

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing or incorrect entries (e.g., null values in pricing fields).
  - Normalise the data, especially if using datasets from multiple cities or regions (e.g., different currencies, date formats).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Understand the Data**: Analyse the dataset to understand key variables. What factors influence price? How does it vary by location or time of year? Which features correlate with higher review scores?
- **Visualisations**: Create visualisations to explore patterns, such as histograms for price distributions or time series charts for booking trends.

## 4. Build the Machine Learning Models

### A. Pricing Recommendations
- **Model Type**: Begin with **Regression Models** (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or XGBoost) to predict pricing based on property features like location, type, and review counts.
- **Data Input**: Listing details, such as number of bedrooms, location, property type, and historical booking prices.
- **Training**: Use past booking data to train the model, determining the best price ranges for different property attributes.

### B. Peak Booking Time Prediction
- **Model Type**: Use **Time Series Forecasting** (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) to predict when peak booking periods will occur. This helps hosts adjust prices dynamically.
- **Data Input**: Date-based booking data (e.g., when bookings were made, seasonal trends, holiday effects).
- **Training**: Train the model using seasonal data, detecting patterns and spikes in demand.

### C. Feature Preferences
- **Model Type**: Apply **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to analyse guest reviews and identify commonly mentioned features (e.g., cleanliness, Wi-Fi, location). This can inform hosts on what amenities to prioritise.
- **Data Input**: Guest reviews.
- **Training**: Use NLP models (e.g., TF-IDF, BERT) to extract important keywords and sentiments from reviews. Cluster similar reviews to find recurring themes.

### D. Property Description Optimisation
- **Model Type**: Implement **Recommender Systems** or classification models to suggest how hosts can optimise their property descriptions.
- **Data Input**: Historical property descriptions and their success rate (e.g., booking frequency, review scores).
- **Training**: Analyse top-performing property descriptions to identify the best practices (e.g., certain keywords, tone, structure).

## 5. Data Outputs
- **Actionable Insights**: Ensure the tool provides clear, actionable insights such as recommended pricing ranges, peak booking periods, or tips for improving property descriptions. Simple charts or visualisations can make the data more accessible to hosts.

## 6. Backend and Frontend Development
- **Backend**:
  - Use **Python** with libraries such as Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for data processing and machine learning models.
  - Store data in a **relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL) to manage listings and booking information efficiently.

- **Frontend**:
  - **User Interface (UI)**: Develop a straightforward, user-friendly web interface for hosts to input property details and receive recommendations. Use frameworks such as **Flask** or **Django** for the backend, and **React** or **Vue.js** for the frontend.
  - Alternatively, use **Streamlit** for a lightweight web app, ideal for rapid prototyping and deployment.

## 7. Evaluation and Testing
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to assess pricing prediction models, and accuracy or precision metrics for the description optimisation model.
- **User Testing**: Conduct testing with a small group of Airbnb hosts to gather feedback on the accuracy of the tool and the overall user experience. Iterate based on feedback.

## 8. Deployment
- Deploy the tool on a **cloud platform** (AWS, GCP, or Heroku) to ensure it is accessible online.
- Integrate with the Inside Airbnb data API (if available) to ensure regular updates, allowing users to access the most recent data.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Scalability**: Once the tool is successful for one city, scale it to include data from multiple regions.
- **Monetisation**: If you plan to offer this tool as a service, consider monetisation strategies, such as a subscription model, freemium version, or paid premium insights.

By following this roadmap, you’ll create a well-structured Airbnb data tool that leverages machine learning to deliver valuable insights to hosts.
