# Project Timeline

## 06/10/2024
- Plan for project is to make a tool that can take a listing and generate a reasonable price?
- definition is not concrete yet hence why I'll be doing more research
- ML models (regression) to take quantitative data such as number of rooms to help determine price
- Image classification / feature extraction to take images and use this to help determine price

### Current articles I am reading:
- https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJCHM-05-2022-0562/full/html (article1.pdf)
- - looks at using ensemble learning to predict listing prices without amenity-driven features
