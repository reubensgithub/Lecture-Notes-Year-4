# Project Timeline

## 06/10/2024
- Plan for project is to make a tool that can take a listing and generate a reasonable price?
- definition is not concrete yet hence why I'll be doing more research
- ML models (regression) to take quantitative data such as number of rooms to help determine price
- Image classification / feature extraction to take images and use this to help determine price

### Current articles I am reading:
- https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJCHM-05-2022-0562/full/html (article1.pdf)
- - looks at using ensemble learning to predict listing prices without amenity-driven features
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9253078 (article2.pdf)
- - 

## 10/10/2024
### Plan for next meeting
- Discuss ethics issues (asking other people to test our tool or if we'll need other people's data to train models)
- Structure of tool
- Work on smaller city such as Bristol
**Define Key Problems:**
Pricing Recommendation:
- Use regression models to predict optimal pricing based on factors such as location, size, amenities, and seasonality.

Occupancy Prediction:
- Use classification or regression to predict occupancy rates based on time of year, price, and property features.

Feature Importance:
- Use feature importance techniques (e.g., in Random Forest, SHAP values) to determine which property features correlate with higher prices or bookings.

Ask about model training (using Colab and getting paid plan)

Overall goal is to create a tool to predict pricing, occupancy and feature importance for Airbnb hosts.


## 23/10/2024
Work on literature review and cancel meeting this week. Work has not been sufficient enough to warrant a meeting

## 31/10/2024
- So far, have written about a page
- Need to work on it until Sunday and produce a good few more pages by then for the next meeting.

## PLAN (written roughly 11/11/2024):
- Continue introduction by explaining smart pricing and its competitors, talk about maximising revenue while keeping occupancy rates high
- For context, talk more about airbnb, pricing landscape, (with regular properties too), factors influencing price (location, seasonality, demand)
- Highlight how price impacts hosts and guests and relevance to the broader industry
- Talk about market segmentation (who stays at airbnbs, what drives their preferences, customer types, factors that influence decisions, domain knowledge)
- Data availability (data techniques, compare inside airbnb vs scraper), delve into legal and ethical aspects
- Key literature review comparing papers, what techniques they're using, highlighting best techniques, compare strengths vs limitations, focus on pieces directly related to airbnb pricing.
- foundational materials such as books.
- Specifications (functional vs non-functional requirements)
- Risk assessment
- Evaluation
- Conclusion

# PLAN FOR TODAY
- Put bulk of intro into context
- Gantt chart for timeline
- Use figures and talk about low-end pricing and high-end pricing. Reference airbnb search queries
- Follow spec and write accordingly. Objectives could be done in paragraphs outlining priority etc.

- hypothesis statement being that customers will get a better experience with renting out properties and earning profit
when using my pricing tool 

- talk about ML techniques that are relevant (like random forests, standard LR, not MLR etc)
