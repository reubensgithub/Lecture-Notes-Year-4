# Project Timeline

## 06/10/2024
- Plan for project is to make a tool that can take a listing and generate a reasonable price?
- definition is not concrete yet hence why I'll be doing more research
- ML models (regression) to take quantitative data such as number of rooms to help determine price
- Image classification / feature extraction to take images and use this to help determine price

### Current articles I am reading:
- https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJCHM-05-2022-0562/full/html (article1.pdf)
- - looks at using ensemble learning to predict listing prices without amenity-driven features
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9253078 (article2.pdf)

### Plan for next meeting
- Discuss ethics issues (asking other people to test our tool or if we'll need other people's data to train models)
- Structure of tool
- Work on smaller city such as Bristol
**Define Key Problems:**
Pricing Recommendation:
- Use regression models to predict optimal pricing based on factors such as location, size, amenities, and seasonality.

Occupancy Prediction:
- Use classification or regression to predict occupancy rates based on time of year, price, and property features.

Feature Importance:
- Use feature importance techniques (e.g., in Random Forest, SHAP values) to determine which property features correlate with higher prices or bookings.

Ask about model training (using Colab and getting paid plan)
