# Image Filtering

## Image as a function
We can think of a (grayscale) image as a function, f, from R^2 to R:
- f(x, y) gives the intensity at position (x, y)
- A digital image is a discrete (sampled, quantized) version of this function.#

## Image transformations
- As with any function, we can apply operators to an image
