# Simulation of Queueing Network Models

## Queueing Network
A queueing network is a collection of inter-connected nodes
that consist of queues and servers and are all connected to each other.

Queueing Network: a model in which jobs departing from one
queue arrive at another queue (or possibly the same queue).

Queueing Networks:
▪ Open Queuing Networks (jobs may enter and leave the system)
▪ Closed Queueing Networks (a fixed set of jobs circulate
between servers)

## Open-Queueing Network
Open Queueing Networks: have external arrivals and departures
and thus the number of jobs in the system varies with time.

Examples of Open Queueing Networks to
consider:
▪ Queues in Tandem with two nodes
▪ Queues in Tandem with multiple nodes
▪ Open Queueing Networks with arbitrary
topology
